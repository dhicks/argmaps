    "text": "Argdown is software designed to turn pieces of text into argument maps, visual representations of the structure of an argument or debate. This page has instructions for two ways of setting up this software: you can use a website called the Argdown Sandbox, or you can download and install Argdown on your computer, along with notetaking software called Obsidian.\nBoth options for using Argdown are completely free, and either one will work to generate argument maps for this course. The Argdown Sandbox doesn’t require any setup — you just open up a website and start typing — but doesn’t have a simple way to save your work. Using Argdown with Obsidian requires you to download and install some software on your computer. It’s easy to use Obsidian to save your argument maps; but the software hasn’t been vetted by our campus IT office. That means there’s a security risk installing this software."

    "text": "2.1 Using the Argdown Sandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe Argdown Sandbox uses the default color scheme, which is not colorblind-friendly. And unfortunately I can’t figure out how to change the color scheme. If you or someone you work with has trouble with the default color scheme, you’ll need to use Obsidian.\n\n\nUsing the Argdown Sandbox is simple: simply open a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/, and you should see the same thing as Figure 2.1. Since you’ll be creating argument maps pretty regularly in this class, you’ll probably want to bookmark that link.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Argdown Sandbox: https://argdown.org/sandbox/\n\n\nMost of the Sandbox is taken up by the text pane (left) and preview pane (right). Notice that you can’t click or do anything in the preview pane. But click anywhere in the text pane, hit ⌘+a (Control+a on Windows) to select all, then hit backspace or delete to clear out the demo text. Type the following, including at least two spaces or a tab at the start of the second line:\nI'm a premise \n  +> I'm a conclusion\nAt the very top-right, there’s a list of rendering options (methods for representing the text in the text pane): HTML, Map, and JSON, then two outgoing links for Documentation (the Argdown homepage) and the Argdown source code on GitHub.\nIf you’re in HTML mode, you should see something like Figure 2.2 in the preview pane.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox in HTML mode\n\n\nTo view the argument map itself, select Map mode in the upper-right, then click Dagre D3 Map at the top of the preview pane. The whole thing should look like Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox with Dagre D3 Map mode\n\n\n\n2.1.1 How your computer is organized\nIf you use your computer primarily through free-text search boxes — just type in a word or phrase and scroll through the results — you might not be used to thinking about how your computer is actually organized. One side effect of Argdown is that you’ll need to be deliberate about where your save your argument maps.\nYour computer is organized like a physical filing cabinet, with drawers containing folders containing (paper) files. (Except the drawers are also called folders, and you can have folders inside of folders inside of folders inside of folders.) Every file on your computer lives in its particular folder, and everything containing files is a folder. This includes your desktop, which is a representation of a special folder tied to your user account on your computer. Apps are also collections of files organized together into folders; installing an app means copying that folder structure into certain places on your device and configuring the operating system to interact with the app’s files. All computers are organized like this, including your phone, a smartwatch, an Alexa or Siri, a Ring doorbell, etc.\nFigure 2.4 shows you how I keep all the different files for our class organized into a collection of folders, as viewed using Mac OS’s Finder app in column mode. (Windows has a similar app called File Explorer.) The Teaching folder contains everything related to all of the classes I’ve taught, past and present. critical reasoning is dedicated to this specific class, with separate folders for each year. Inside I have further folders, for things like quizzes, the syllabus, writing assignments, and final grades. The slides folder contains all of the lecture slides. At the bottom of the window, I have Finder configured to show the path, or the location of the particular folder or file being highlighted. The path starts with my laptop’s hard drive (this might look like C: on Windows), then the Users folder. The Users folder contains files specific to each account on this computer. There’s only one user account on my laptop, danhicks, but some systems — like our campus email server — will have thousands of user accounts. Imagine how many user folders must be in the Gmail and Facebook servers.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Files organized into folders, as viewed by Mac OS’s Finder in column mode\n\n\nInside my user folder, danhicks, is a specific folder that I sync to the cloud using Google Drive. All of my teaching files are contained in this folder, so that they’re synced automatically. I also backup my files to an external hard drive using the Mac app Time Machine, plus the cloud service Backblaze. Triple protection in case something happens to my computer! (The “cloud” is really just physical computers located somewhere else, usually in giant warehouse-like buildings near cheap sources of electricity.)\nThanks to fast search software, we’ve gotten used to not having to interact with files and folder organization directly in a lot of cases. I don’t need to know exactly where a certain form is located on the campus website; a web search will turn it up in a few seconds. But deliberately organizing your own files into folders is important. For one thing, it makes it much easier to find related files, especially files with similar names or content. I’ve taught a lot of classes over the last 15+ years. So if I’m looking for the syllabus for the Fall 2020 version of Critical Reasoning, a search for syllabus is going to turn up a lot of results. It’s much faster to go to the folder for Critical Reasoning, then Fall 2020, and then the syllabus folder. Then, if I’m looking at that syllabus and want to look up the writing assignment I used in that course, I don’t need to remember exactly what I called the writing assignment file or what keywords might bring it up. I just click a couple of times to open the folder for the writing assignment.\nThere’s also a technical reason for not leaving all of your files on your desktop. Your computer assumes that files on your desktop are important and frequently accessed. So it keeps a kind of pre-loaded copy of the file in memory, so that it can open the file quickly whenever you might need it. Having hundreds or even thousands of files on your desktop can seriously slow down your computer.\n\n\n2.1.2 Saving your work in the Argdown Sandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Argdown Sandbox has no way to save your work\n\n\n\nIt’s meant to be a quick preview of what Argdown can do, not a space for you to regularly do important work. You’ll need to manually save your work by copying and pasting to a file on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you save your work for the first time, create a designated folder for all of the work for this course. I’m going to call this the course folder. The Documents folder on your computer is a good place to do this. If you don’t know how to find your Documents folder and create a new folder there, your instructor and TA can help.\n\n\nOnce you’ve created the course folder, follow these steps to save a new argument map. Try them out with the example you typed in to the text pane a few minutes ago.\n\nOpen the app TextEdit (on a Mac) or Notepad (on Windows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can use any plaintext editor of your choice. But Microsoft Word and Google Docs won’t work.\n\n\n\nCreate a new file, and copy and paste the argument map text from the Argdown Sandbox into the new file.\nOn a Mac: You may need to go to Format -> Make Plain Text. See Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Changing TextEdit to plaintext mode\n\n\nHit ⌘+s (Mac) or Control+s (Windows) to bring up the save dialog.\n\nMake sure you’re saving to the course folder.\nMake sure the file type is set to “plain text” or “txt”.\n\n\n\nWhen you want to open up a saved argument map, you’ll need to follow these steps.\n\nFind the argument map file in the course folder, and open it with your text editor.\n\nSelect the entire argument map text, then copy it.\nOpen the Argdown Sandbox by navigating a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/.\nSelect the example text in the text pane, then paste the argument map text.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Saving an image file from the Argdown Sandbox\nAfter creating an argument map in the Argdown Sandbox, you can download an image file by clicking on png near the upper-right. Hit “Create PNG” in the dialog box, and you’ll automatically download an image file named map.png. Move this to the course folder, and give it the same name as the corresponding text file."

    "section": "2.2 Using Argdown with Obsidian",
    "text": "2.2 Using Argdown with Obsidian\nObsidian is notetaking and knowledge base software. If you’ve used the website Notion, it’s somewhat similar. We can use Obsidian with Argdown using a community-developed plugin. Both Obsidian and the Argdown plugin are entirely free. Creating argument maps is just a little more complicated than using the Argdown Sandbox, but as an app on your computer it’s simple to save and open argument maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you’re going with this option, remember that OIT has not vetted Obsidian for security and privacy. Be sure not to store any sensitive information in Obsidian.\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Installing Obsidian and the Argdown plugin\nTo setup and install Obsidian and the Argdown plugin, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate a web browser to https://obsidian.md/ and click the download link for your operating system. After the download finishes, run the installer.\n\nOpen Obsidian. It should show you the “open vault” window in Figure 2.6.\n\nIf you already created a course folder, choose “Open folder as vault,” and select your course folder as an Obsidian vault. This won’t mess up your existing files in any way; Obsidian plays nicely with other apps.\n\nIf you haven’t already created a course folder, choose “Create new vault.” Give your vault/course folder a name like “Critical Reasoning” and set its location to be something like your Documents folder.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Obsidian’s “open vault” window\n\n\nNavigate a browser to https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=argdown. (Or, from the Obsidian homepage, click “Plugins” and then type argdown into the search box.) Click the “Open in Obsidian” link. You might need to tell your web browser to use Obsidian for the link.\n\nObsidian should open and display information about the plugin. See Figure 2.7. Click “Install.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Installing the Argdown plugin for Obsidian\n\n\nAfter installation, in Obsidian, click on the gear icon (lower-left) to open Settings. Look for Community Plugins on the left, then the “Installed plugins” section in the main pane. Find the Argdown plugin and click the toggle to activate it.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Creating an argument map in Obsidian\nOnce the Argdown plugin is installed and activated, you can add an argument map to any Obsidian note. Your first time through, follow these steps.\n\nCreate a new note (you can click the “New Note” icon on the upper-left, or hit ⌘+n on a Mac or Control-N on Windows).\n\n(Optional) Give the note a name, like “first argument map.” Obsidian automatically saves any changes to your files.\n\nType the following:\n```argdown\nI'm a premise \n   +> I'm a conclusion\n```\nClick on the glasses icon in the upper-right to switch Obsidian into reading mode. This will prompt the Argdown plugin to render the argument map, turning it into an interactive widget like the Argdown Sandbox. See Figure 2.8. If you see text instead of the map, click the “Map” button.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Rendered argument map in Obsidian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the rest of this tutorial, I won’t include the ```argdown line at the top or the ``` at the end. You need to use these special symbols (called code fencing) to tell Obsidian that it needs to run the argument map through Argdown.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Saving an argument map as a PDF file\nObsidian doesn’t have a built-in way to generate image files or Word docx files. (I haven’t tested it, but it looks like the plugin Obsidian Pandoc can do this for you.) But it can generate PDF files, which will work just fine for our class.\nTo export a note as PDF, click on the three dots icon (upper right) to open the More Options menu. Export to PDF is at the bottom. After clicking the Export to PDF button, a save dialog will pop up. I recommend saving it in the same folder as the argument map itself, so that you can always find them together.\n\n\n2.2.4 Doing more with Obsidian\nFor this class, this is pretty much all you need to know about Obsidian. But it’s much more powerful: you can add formatting (including emphasis, bold, headings, lists), insert images and links, and visualize a folder of notes as a network, without adding any other plugins. There are lots of tutorials for Obsidian online."

    "text": "Let’s start with a simple argument for a campus mask mandate:\n\nMasks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19. So our campus should have a mask mandate.\n\nThis argument has a single premise (in blue) and a conclusion (in green; it has the indicator word so. To start mapping out this argument, we start with the conclusion. Enter this into either the Argdown Sandbox or Obsidian.\n[mandate]: our campus should have a mask mandate\nWe give the conclusion a title, [mandate], so that we can construct multiple arguments that involve it without having to type and retype it again and again.\nNext we’ll add the premise, and indicate that it supports the conclusion. Like the conclusion, we give the premise a name so that we can refer back to it again. Argdown has a few different ways of indicating support relationships. All of the following are equivalent:\n[masks effective]: Masks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19.\n    +> [mandate]\n    \n[mandate]\n    <+ [masks effective]: Masks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19.\n\n[mandate] \n    + [masks effective]: Masks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe can refer to claims (premises or conclusions) using just the title, without having to type them out again and again.\n\n\nThe first version has the premise, followed by the conclusion. The second and third start with the conclusion, then give the premise. Notice that the direction of the arrow is reversed between the first and second versions. Support always goes from the premise and to the conclusion. The third version can be useful for showing how an conclusion can be supported by multiple independent arguments; more on that later. Whichever way you write out the argument in Argdown, you should see this when you visualize it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry each version of the argument separately. Confirm that the argument maps are identical in each case.\nWhat happens if you reverse one of the arrows?\nConstruct a map for the following argument:\n\n\nBikes, scooters, and the bus all have a lower carbon footprint than individual cars. So campus should encourage people to take bikes, scooters, and the bus."

    "text": "3.2 Independent arguments for the same conclusion\nConsider the following passage:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases. (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nThis argument has one conclusion sentence (in bold) and three premises, in red, blue, and purple. These premises form independent arguments: the first challenges scientific evidence, the second explains benefits of animal agriculture, and the third is about research on the health benefits of eating meat. Because they’re talking about different aspects of the debate over animal agriculture, these arguments are independent of each other. Here’s how we can represent these three independent arguments in an argument map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost of the argument maps in this tutorial will be interactive. You can click on the Source button to view the underlying Argdown code.\n\n\n\n[not bad for enviro or people]: Animal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. \n\n[bad science]: The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n[unusuable land]: Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n    \n[meat healthy]: New scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nnot bad for enviro or people\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the\n environment and it is not bad for\n people. \n\n\n\nn1\n\nbad science\nThe so-called scientific studies\n purporting to show that animals are\n bad for the environment have been\n repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nunusuable land\nRuminant animals, like cattle and\n sheep, are among the most sustainable\n food production systems on Earth,\n taking unusable land and waste\n products from vegetable and grain\n production, and turning it into\n healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nmeat healthy\nNew scientific research is coming out\n showing that meat is extremely good\n for our health, and that a high-meat\n diet free of processed foods can\n actually reverse all kinds of chronic\n diseases.\n\n\n\nn3->n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might have occurred to you that there are actually two conclusions in this argument:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment.\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for people.\n\nDifferent arguments support different conclusions. We can modify the Argdown source code, separating the conclusions and indicating which arguments support which conclusion.\n\n[not bad for enviro]: Animal agriculture is not bad for the environment. \n\n[not bad for people]: Animal agriculture is not bad for people. \n\n\n[bad science]: The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n    +> [not bad for enviro]\n\n[unusuable land]: Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n    +> [not bad for enviro]\n    +> [not bad for people]\n    \n[meat healthy]: New scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.\n    +> [not bad for people]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nnot bad for enviro\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the\n environment. \n\n\n\nn1\n\nnot bad for people\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for\n people. \n\n\n\nn2\n\nbad science\nThe so-called scientific studies\n purporting to show that animals are\n bad for the environment have been\n repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nunusuable land\nRuminant animals, like cattle and\n sheep, are among the most sustainable\n food production systems on Earth,\n taking unusable land and waste\n products from vegetable and grain\n production, and turning it into\n healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\n\nn3->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3->n1\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nmeat healthy\nNew scientific research is coming out\n showing that meat is extremely good\n for our health, and that a high-meat\n diet free of processed foods can\n actually reverse all kinds of chronic\n diseases.\n\n\n\nn4->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of putting each claim of an argument in its own box. The premise meat healthy isn’t an argument for the not bad for enviro conclusion; it’s only making claims about the health effects of eating meat. And someone might present an objection to the unusuable land premise without addressing the other two, independent arguments.\n\n\nConstruct a map of the following argument:\n\n\nEating animals is wrong for a variety of reasons. First, many animals are sentient creatures that have thoughts and emotions. Second, we should not cause animals to suffer if we don’t need to. Finally, raising animals for food uses resources, like grain, that could be used to feed hungry people around the world."

    "text": "5.2 Objecting to a premise\nAgain, an objection is an argument whose conclusion is that (a) another argument has a false premise, or (b) another argument’s premises don’t support its conclusion. Let’s start with the first kind of objection, which challenges a premise.\nA premise in an argument is just a claim, like any other, which means it can be supported or opposed with arguments. In her 1973 article “On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion,” the ethicist Mary Anne Warren gave a critique of the pro-life claim that an embryo has a right to life from conception. Here’s my paraphrase of her critique:\n\nAn embryo lacks consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to community, and self-awareness. But only beings with these capacities have a right to life. So an embryo does not have a right to life.\n\nThis argument has two interdependent premises, so we use premise-conclusion form, as in the previous section. Remember to label the premises of Warren’s argument. To show that the conclusion of Warren’s argument is opposed to [right to life], leave the conclusion line blank and put -> [right to life] on the next line (check the Source code if you’re confused).\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n[bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n    +> [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n    \n<Warren's objection>\n\n(1) [W1]: An embryo lacks these capacities.\n(2) [W2]: Only beings with the capacity for consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to communicate, and self-awareness have a right to life. \n----\n(3) \n  -> [right to life]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nW1\nAn embryo lacks these capacities.\n\n\n\nn5\n\nWarren's objection\n\n\n\nn3->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nW2\nOnly beings with the capacity for\n consciousness, the capacity to feel\n pain, self-motivated activity, the\n capacity to communicate, and\n self-awareness have a right to life. \n\n\n\nn4->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn5->n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn opposing argument is not much better than mere disagreement (where one side makes a claim and the other side says the opposite, without any arguments). Opposing arguments give us some insight into how each side of a debate thinks about the issue. But objections help us understand what one side thinks of the other side’s arguments. This can lead to deeper insights: What’s the fundamental disagreement between the two sides? Where do they agree? Tracing out a complex debate, using tools like argument maps, might not resolve a controversy, but they can help us understand it better.\nA number of philosophers and other writers, including the ethicist Don Marquis, responded to Warren’s argument by pointing out that coma patients have a right to life.\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n[bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n    +> [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n    \n<Warren's objection>\n\n(1) [W1]: An embryo lacks these capacities.\n(2) [W2]: Only beings with the capacity for consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to communicate, and self-awareness have a right to life. \n----\n(3) \n  -> [right to life]\n  \n<Marquis' reply>\n\n(1) [M1]: Coma patients lack consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to communicate, and self-awareness.  \n(2) [M2]: Coma patients have a right to life. \n----\n(3)\n  -> [W2]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nW1\nAn embryo lacks these capacities.\n\n\n\nn7\n\nWarren's objection\n\n\n\nn3->n7\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nW2\nOnly beings with the capacity for\n consciousness, the capacity to feel\n pain, self-motivated activity, the\n capacity to communicate, and\n self-awareness have a right to life. \n\n\n\nn4->n7\n\n\n\n\n\nn5\n\nM1\nComa patients lack consciousness, the\n capacity to feel pain, self-motivated\n activity, the capacity to communicate,\n and self-awareness. \n\n\n\nn8\n\nMarquis' reply\n\n\n\nn5->n8\n\n\n\n\n\nn6\n\nM2\nComa patients have a right to life. \n\n\n\nn6->n8\n\n\n\n\n\nn7->n2\n\n\n\n\n\nn8->n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis kind of objection to a previous objection is called a reply. In philosophy classes, you’ll often be asked to write papers where you present an argument, an objection, and finally a reply to that objection.\nMarquis didn’t just give a reply to Warren’s objection. He offered his own argument for an embryo’s right to life. He calls it the “future-like-ours” argument, because it appeals to the idea that “The future of a standard fetus includes a set of experiences, projects, activities, and such which are identical with the futures of adult human beings and are identical with the futures of young children,” and that a fetus has a right to life because it has the potential for this kind of future. Marquis also argues that this “future-like-ours” view explains why temporary coma patients, at least, have a right to life: because they have the potential to awaken and lead a more-or-less typical adult human life.\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n[bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n    +> [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n    \n<Warren's objection>\n\n(1) [W1]: An embryo lacks these capacities.\n(2) [W2]: Only beings with the capacity for consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to communicate, and self-awareness have a right to life. #right-to-life-condition\n----\n(3) \n  -> [right to life]\n  \n<Marquis' reply>\n\n(1) [M1]: Coma patients lack consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to communicate, and self-awareness.  \n(2) [M2]: Coma patients have a right to life. \n----\n(3)\n  -> [W2]\n  \n\n[future-like-ours]: Any being with the potential to lead a future-like-ours has a right to life. #right-to-life-condition\n\n<Future-like-ours argument: Coma patient>\n\n(1) [future-like-ours]\n(2) [future-coma]: Temporary coma patients have this potential\n----\n(3) [M2]\n\n<Future-like-ours argument: Embryo>\n\n(1) [future-like-ours]\n(2) [future-embryo]: An embryo has this potential\n----\n(3) [right to life]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nW1\nAn embryo lacks these capacities.\n\n\n\nn10\n\nWarren's objection\n\n\n\nn3->n10\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nW2\nOnly beings with the capacity for\n consciousness, the capacity to feel\n pain, self-motivated activity, the\n capacity to communicate, and\n self-awareness have a right to life.\n #right-to-life-condition\n\n\n\nn4->n10\n\n\n\n\n\nn5\n\nM1\nComa patients lack consciousness, the\n capacity to feel pain, self-motivated\n activity, the capacity to communicate,\n and self-awareness. \n\n\n\nn11\n\nMarquis' reply\n\n\n\nn5->n11\n\n\n\n\n\nn6\n\nM2\nComa patients have a right to life. \n\n\n\nn6->n11\n\n\n\n\n\nn7\n\nfuture-like-ours\nAny being with the potential to lead a\n future-like-ours has a right to life.\n #right-to-life-condition\n\n\n\nn12\n\nFuture-like-ours argument: Coma patient\n\n\n\nn7->n12\n\n\n\n\n\nn13\n\nFuture-like-ours argument: Embryo\n\n\n\nn7->n13\n\n\n\n\n\nn8\n\nfuture-coma\nTemporary coma patients have this\n potential\n\n\n\nn8->n12\n\n\n\n\n\nn9\n\nfuture-embryo\nAn embryo has this potential\n\n\n\nn9->n13\n\n\n\n\n\nn10->n2\n\n\n\n\n\nn11->n4\n\n\n\n\n\nn12->n6\n\n\n\n\n\nn13->n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing this argument map, we can identify a fundamental disagreement between the pro-choice and pro-life positions on abortion (at least as those positions are represented by Warren and Marquis). I’ve highlighted two key claims using the hashtag #right-to-life-condition. Warren’s view connects the right to life to actually having certain capacities now, while Marquis’ view connects the right to life to the potential to have certain capacities in the future.\n\nConsider this argument, which we met earlier in Chapter 3:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases. (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nUsing the rules from Chapter 1 of Rulebook for Arguments, develop an objection to one of the premises of this argument, and then a reply to your objection. Present your objection and reply using an argument map."

    "section": "5.3 Objecting to support",
    "text": "5.3 Objecting to support\nThe other way that we can object to an argument is to challenge the support relationship between premises and conclusion. That is, we might accept all of an argument’s premises, but still think that they don’t give a good reason to accept the conclusion. In the rest of this semester, we’ll learn lots of different tools to assess support for different kinds of arguments. For instance, when we talk about generalizations, or arguments by example, we’ll introduce a rule that generalizations need more than one example. A generalization with a single example can have a true premise — this thing did happen in this one particular case — but, because it violates the rule, it doesn’t give much support to the conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStudents often have a lot of trouble with the idea of support. It’s okay if you don’t get it at first. Think of this course as teaching how to recognize how support works for different kinds of arguments.\n\n\nTo illustrate objecting to support, let’s go back to our basic opposition between bodily autonomy and an embryo’s right to life. A pro-life person might agree that bodily autonomy — the right to do what you want with your own body — is important. But, they might continue, not all rights are equally important. Specifically, someone’s right to life takes precedence over other rights. As a nineteenth-century aphorism put it, “My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins.”\nThis objection challenges the pro-choice argument, but it doesn’t challenge the premise of bodily autonomy. Instead it challenges the support, the link, between that premise and the conclusion of legal abortion. In Argdown, we can represent this by opposing an argument label, rather than a premise. To do this, we’ll need to label the bodily autonomy argument and present it in premise-conclusion form.\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n<Bodily autonomy argument> \n\n(1) [bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n----\n(2) [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n\n[precedence]: Someone's right to life takes precedence over another person's right to bodily autonomy\n    -> <Bodily autonomy argument>\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn4\n\nBodily autonomy argument\n\n\n\nn1->n4\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nprecedence\nSomeone's right to life takes\n precedence over another person's right\n to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn3->n4\n\n\n\n\n\nn4->n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way a pro-choice person might reply to this argument is to make a distinction between killing someone and letting them die. Many people would say there’s a difference between letting a young child drown in a bathtub and actively holding them underwater until they drown. One version of this distinction is in terms of intentions: if the child managed to save themselves, you wouldn’t reach down and push them back under. Someone might go on to argue that letting someone die doesn’t violate their right to life — it was sort of an accident or unintended consequence — and that abortion is letting an embryo die — if the embryo someone managed to survive the procedure, you wouldn’t actively try to kill it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe drowning children example comes from a paper by the ethicist James Rachels. Rachels’ point was to challenge the distinction: he claims that there’s actually no morally significant difference between these two cases.\n\n\nThis reply to the precedence objection again targets the support of the argument. The objection can agree that the right to life takes precedence over bodily autonomy. But, they claim, the right to life isn’t violated in abortion, because abortion is letting an embryo die rather than killing it.\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n<Bodily autonomy argument> \n\n(1) [bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n----\n(2) [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n\n<Precedence objection>\n\n(1) [precedence]: Someone's right to life takes precedence over another person's right to bodily autonomy\n----\n(2) \n    -> <Bodily autonomy argument>\n\n<Killing vs. letting die reply>\n\n(1) [killing vs. letting die]: Unlike killing, letting someone die does not violate their right to life\n(2) [abortion is letting die]: Abortion is letting an embryo die, not killing it\n----\n(3) [C]: Abortion does not violate an embryo's right to life\n    -> <Precedence objection>\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn7\n\nBodily autonomy argument\n\n\n\nn1->n7\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nprecedence\nSomeone's right to life takes\n precedence over another person's right\n to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn8\n\nPrecedence objection\n\n\n\nn3->n8\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nkilling vs. letting die\nUnlike killing, letting someone die\n does not violate their right to life\n\n\n\nn9\n\nKilling vs. letting die reply\n\n\n\nn4->n9\n\n\n\n\n\nn5\n\nabortion is letting die\nAbortion is letting an embryo die, not\n killing it\n\n\n\nn5->n9\n\n\n\n\n\nn6\n\nC\nAbortion does not violate an embryo's\n right to life\n\n\n\nn6->n8\n\n\n\n\n\nn7->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn8->n7\n\n\n\n\n\nn9->n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is a useful example for showing how we represent objections and replies in argument maps, I don’t think it’s a very compelling reply to the objection. In my opinion, both premises have problems. First, many homeless people in our society die of exposure and treatable diseases. This is letting them die — we don’t actively hunt down homeless people who survive these challenges — but denying them access to housing and health care does, I think, violate their right to life. Second, it’s not clear to me what the difference is supposed to be between ending a pregnancy and ending the life of the embryo or fetus involved in that pregnancy, i.e., killing it. It seems to me like these are just two ways of describing the same action.\n\nExpand the argument map above to include my two objections to the killing vs. letting die reply. Are these objections to support or objections to premises?"

    "text": "6.1 The pollution argument\nThe first guest on the program is Rajinder Sahota, an official at the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which regulates air pollution in the state. Sahota is on the show as the primary proponent of the biofuels proposal, and Madrigal asks her to make the basic pro-biofuels argument:\n\nAM: So first things first, I kind of want to get to the pro case. Like why the refinery should do this. First, from your perspective, what are the benefits of switching to these renewable feedstocks?\nRajinder Sahota: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.

    "text": "6.2 The “not all feedstocks” objection\nMadrigal responds by questioning the premise of the carbon emissions argument.\n\nAM: So is that true for all feedstocks or just certain of these renewable feedstocks? Like we know the profile is kind of different if it’s like virgin palm oil versus like recycled vegetable oil or something like that?\n\nWe can paraphrase this question as a declarative statement: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits. This is a generalization or argument by example, supported by the example of virgin palm oil. Because this argument is challenging a premise of the carbon emissions argument, it’s an objection to that argument. We’ll give it an argument label, the not all feedstocks objection, to highlight the sub-debate that develops around this objection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe link is to a page by an organization called the International Council on Clean Transportation. Using the SIFT method, you should ask yourself: What is this organization? Who are they, who funds them, and what’s their agenda? The organization has a Wikipedia page, which indicates that it’s funded by an organization whose “mission is to slow global warming”. But not much more information. A Google Search for “palm oil carbon emissions” turns up a number of other sources making similar claims about high carbon emissions from palm oil.\n\n\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n    \n[not all feedstocks]: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits.\n    +> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n      -> [carbon emissions]\n\n[virgin palm oil]: Virgin palm oil does not have these pollution benefits.\n    +> [not all feedstocks]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nnot all feedstocks\nNot all renewable feedstocks have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn5\n\nNot all feedstocks objection\n\n\n\nn3->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nvirgin palm oil\nVirgin palm oil does not have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn4->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn5->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRS: We do not support any kinds of feedstocks, that are purposely grown such as palm that are meant to convert forests or other kinds of lands to produce renewable diesel. So there are some protections already built in. Because if you’re converting that land, you’re losing carbon and you don’t get a good benefit from that from a climate perspective.\n\nThis is a concession: RS agrees that the pollution argument only applies to things like recycled vegetable oil, not virgin palm oil. It amounts to an objection to the validity of the “not all feedstocks” argument: its premise (not all feedstocks) doesn’t support it’s conclusion (not-carbon emissions) because carbon emissions isn’t supposed to apply to absolutely all possible feedstocks. Because it’s an objection to an objection, Sahota’s claim is a reply.\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n    \n[not all feedstocks]: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits.\n    +> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n      -> [carbon emissions]\n\n[virgin palm oil]: Virgin palm oil does not have these pollution benefits.\n    +> [not all feedstocks]\n\n[CARB doesn't support]: CARB doesn't support refineries using feedstocks like virgin palm oil.\n    -> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nnot all feedstocks\nNot all renewable feedstocks have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn6\n\nNot all feedstocks objection\n\n\n\nn3->n6\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nvirgin palm oil\nVirgin palm oil does not have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn4->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn5\n\nCARB doesn't support\nCARB doesn't support refineries using\n feedstocks like virgin palm oil.\n\n\n\nn5->n6\n\n\n\n\n\nn6->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadrigal asks a followup question, which again can be restated as a declarative statement offering an objection:\n\nAM: Do you have any control over what gets fed into the refinery?\n\nThis is another objection to the support of the previous argument.

So this is an independent argument. It’s not an objection to the pollution arguments, because it doesn’t challenge their premises or their support for the conclusion.
