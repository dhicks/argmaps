    "text": "Mermaid is software designed to turn pieces of text into various kinds of diagrams. We’ll use it to create argument maps, visual representations of the structure of an argument or debate. This page has instructions for two ways of setting up this software: you can use a website called Mermaid Live, or you can download and install notetaking software called Obsidian.\nBoth options for using Mermaid are completely free, and either one will work to generate argument maps for this course. Mermaid Live doesn’t require any setup — you just open up a website and start typing — but has very limited functionality for saving your work. Using Obsidian requires you to download and install some software on your computer. It’s easy to use Obsidian to save your argument maps; but the software hasn’t been vetted by our campus IT office. That means there’s a security risk installing this software."

    "text": "2.1 Using Mermaid Live\n\nall of this\n\nUsing Mermaid Live is simple: simply open a web browser to https://mermaid.live, and you should see the same thing as Figure 2.1. Since you’ll be creating argument maps pretty regularly in this class, you’ll probably want to bookmark that link.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Argdown Sandbox: https://argdown.org/sandbox/\n\n\n\nMost of the Sandbox is taken up by the text pane (left) and preview pane (right). Notice that you can’t click or do anything in the preview pane. But click anywhere in the text pane, hit ⌘+a (Control+a on Windows) to select all, then hit backspace or delete to clear out the demo text. Type the following, including at least two spaces or a tab at the start of the second line:\n\n\n\nShow the code\nflowchart TB\n\nP1(I'm a premise)\nC(I'm the conclusion)\n\nP1 --> C\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nP1(I'm a premise)\nC(I'm the conclusion)\n\nP1 --> C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nClick “Show the code” to show the code to create this argument map\n\n\nExcept, the colors will probably be different. This is because I’m using a special theme for argument maps, with highlighting for premises, conclusions, and objections. Find the Config tab, just above the code box. Clear out that tab, and copy and paste the following:\n{\n    \"themeCSS\": \"#Argument rect {stroke:transparent;fill#e5e5e5!important;} #Argument span {color:transparent;} .edgeLabel {color:#888; font-size:0.9em; margin-right:3px} .edgeLabel i {color:crimson!important;} .edge-pattern-dotted {stroke:crimson!important;} .edge-pattern-solid {stroke:blue!important;} #flowchart-pointEnd {fill:blue;} g rect {fill:white!important;} g[id*='P'] * {stroke:blue!important;fill:white!important;} g[id*='O'] * {stroke:crimson!important; } g[id*='OL'] * {color:white!important;fill:red!important;} g[id*='A'] * {stroke:blue!important;fill:blue!important;color:white!important;} g[id*='C'] * {fill:black!important;color:white!important;font-weight:bold;}\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMermaid Live doesn’t have a sense of different “documents,” so when you delete a previous map to create a new one the theming in Config should stay the same. If your theming gets messed up somehow, you can try the History panel or just copy-and-paste the block up above.\n\n\n\nAt the very top-right, there’s a list of rendering options (methods for representing the text in the text pane): HTML, Map, and JSON, then two outgoing links for Documentation (the Argdown homepage) and the Argdown source code on GitHub.\nIf you’re in HTML mode, you should see something like Figure 2.2 in the preview pane.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox in HTML mode\n\n\nTo view the argument map itself, select Map mode in the upper-right, then click Dagre D3 Map at the top of the preview pane. The whole thing should look like Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox with Dagre D3 Map mode\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 How your computer is organized\nIf you use your computer primarily through free-text search boxes — just type in a word or phrase and scroll through the results — you might not be used to thinking about how your computer is actually organized. One side effect of Argdown is that you’ll need to be deliberate about where your save your argument maps.\nYour computer is organized like a physical filing cabinet, with drawers containing folders containing (paper) files. (Except the drawers are also called folders, and you can have folders inside of folders inside of folders inside of folders.) Every file on your computer lives in its particular folder, and everything containing files is a folder. This includes your desktop, which is a representation of a special folder tied to your user account on your computer. Apps are also collections of files organized together into folders; installing an app means copying that folder structure into certain places on your device and configuring the operating system to interact with the app’s files. All computers are organized like this, including your phone, a smartwatch, an Alexa or Siri, a Ring doorbell, etc.\nFigure 2.4 shows you how I keep all the different files for our class organized into a collection of folders, as viewed using Mac OS’s Finder app in column mode. (Windows has a similar app called File Explorer.) The Teaching folder contains everything related to all of the classes I’ve taught, past and present. critical reasoning is dedicated to this specific class, with separate folders for each year. Inside I have further folders, for things like quizzes, the syllabus, writing assignments, and final grades. The slides folder contains all of the lecture slides. At the bottom of the window, I have Finder configured to show the path, or the location of the particular folder or file being highlighted. The path starts with my laptop’s hard drive (this might look like C: on Windows), then the Users folder. The Users folder contains files specific to each account on this computer. There’s only one user account on my laptop, danhicks, but some systems — like our campus email server — will have thousands of user accounts. Imagine how many user folders must be in the Gmail and Facebook servers.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Files organized into folders, as viewed by Mac OS’s Finder in column mode\n\n\nInside my user folder, danhicks, is a specific folder that I sync to the cloud using Google Drive. All of my teaching files are contained in this folder, so that they’re synced automatically. I also backup my files to an external hard drive using the Mac app Time Machine, plus the cloud service Backblaze. Triple protection in case something happens to my computer! (The “cloud” is really just physical computers located somewhere else, usually in giant warehouse-like buildings near cheap sources of electricity.)\nThanks to fast search software, we’ve gotten used to not having to interact with files and folder organization directly in a lot of cases. I don’t need to know exactly where a certain form is located on the campus website; a web search will turn it up in a few seconds. But deliberately organizing your own files into folders is important. For one thing, it makes it much easier to find related files, especially files with similar names or content. I’ve taught a lot of classes over the last 15+ years. So if I’m looking for the syllabus for the Fall 2020 version of Critical Reasoning, a search for syllabus is going to turn up a lot of results. It’s much faster to go to the folder for Critical Reasoning, then Fall 2020, and then the syllabus folder. Then, if I’m looking at that syllabus and want to look up the writing assignment I used in that course, I don’t need to remember exactly what I called the writing assignment file or what keywords might bring it up. I just click a couple of times to open the folder for the writing assignment.\nThere’s also a technical reason for not leaving all of your files on your desktop. Your computer assumes that files on your desktop are important and frequently accessed. So it keeps a kind of pre-loaded copy of the file in memory, so that it can open the file quickly whenever you might need it. Having hundreds or even thousands of files on your desktop can seriously slow down your computer.\n\n\n2.1.2 Saving your work in the Argdown Sandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Argdown Sandbox has no way to save your work\n\n\n\nIt’s meant to be a quick preview of what Argdown can do, not a space for you to regularly do important work. You’ll need to manually save your work by copying and pasting to a file on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you save your work for the first time, create a designated folder for all of the work for this course. I’m going to call this the course folder. The Documents folder on your computer is a good place to do this. If you don’t know how to find your Documents folder and create a new folder there, your instructor and TA can help.\n\n\nOnce you’ve created the course folder, follow these steps to save a new argument map. Try them out with the example you typed in to the text pane a few minutes ago.\n\nOpen the app TextEdit (on a Mac) or Notepad (on Windows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can use any plaintext editor of your choice. But Microsoft Word and Google Docs won’t work.\n\n\n\nCreate a new file, and copy and paste the argument map text from the Argdown Sandbox into the new file.\nOn a Mac: You may need to go to Format -> Make Plain Text. See Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Changing TextEdit to plaintext mode\n\n\nHit ⌘+s (Mac) or Control+s (Windows) to bring up the save dialog.\n\nMake sure you’re saving to the course folder.\nMake sure the file type is set to “plain text” or “txt”.\n\n\n\nWhen you want to open up a saved argument map, you’ll need to follow these steps.\n\nFind the argument map file in the course folder, and open it with your text editor.\n\nSelect the entire argument map text, then copy it.\nOpen the Argdown Sandbox by navigating a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/.\nSelect the example text in the text pane, then paste the argument map text.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Saving an image file from the Argdown Sandbox\nAfter creating an argument map in the Argdown Sandbox, you can download an image file by clicking on png near the upper-right. Hit “Create PNG” in the dialog box, and you’ll automatically download an image file named map.png. Move this to the course folder, and give it the same name as the corresponding text file."

    "section": "2.2 Using Mermaid with Obsidian",
    "text": "2.2 Using Mermaid with Obsidian\nObsidian is notetaking and knowledge base software. If you’ve used the website Notion, it’s somewhat similar. Obsidian has built-in support for Mermaid. Creating argument maps is just a little more complicated than using Mermaid Live, but as an app on your computer it’s simple to save and open argument maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you’re going with this option, remember that OIT has not vetted Obsidian for security and privacy. Be sure not to store any sensitive information in Obsidian.\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Installing Obsidian\nTo install and setup Obsidian follow these steps:\n\nNavigate a web browser to https://obsidian.md/ and click the download link for your operating system. After the download finishes, run the installer.\n\nOpen Obsidian. It should show you the “open vault” window in Figure 2.6.\n\nIf you already created a course folder, choose “Open folder as vault,” and select your course folder as an Obsidian vault. This won’t mess up your existing files in any way; Obsidian plays nicely with other apps.\n\nIf you haven’t already created a course folder, choose “Create new vault.” Give your vault/course folder a name like “Critical Reasoning” and set its location inside your Documents folder.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Obsidian’s “open vault” window\n\n\nWhile these two steps are all we need to create diagrams, we need one extra step to get the coloring of the diagrams right for argument maps. We’ll do this using a CSS theme. Download and unzip the file mermaid.css.\n\nIn Obsidian, open Settings (gear in the lower-left), then Appearance.\n\nLook for Themes, then the folder icon.\n\nClick on it to open the themes folder.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Opening your vault’s themes folder\n\n\nThis should open a folder called themes in your computer’s file browser. Move mermaid.css (from step 3) into themes.\nBack in Obsidian, click on the Manage button in Themes. Select mermaid.\n\nAll ready to go!\n\n\n2.2.2 Creating an argument map in Obsidian\nYou can add multiple argument maps to any Obsidian note. Your first time through, follow these steps.\n\nCreate a new note (you can click the “New Note” icon on the upper-left, or hit ⌘+n on a Mac or Control-N on Windows).\n\n(Optional) Give the note a name, like “first argument map.” Obsidian automatically saves any changes to your files.\n\nType the following:\n\n\n\nShow the code\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TB\n\nP1(I'm a premise)\nC(I'm the conclusion)\n\nP1 --> C\n```\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nP1(I'm a premise)\nC(I'm the conclusion)\n\nP1 --> C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nClick “Show the code” to show the code to create this argument map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf nothing seems to happen, try replacing the braces with spaces on the first line: ``` mermaid\n\n\n\nHover over the image of your argument map. Click the </> icon to switch back to editing the text of your map.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Switching an Obsidian argument map back to edit mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn the rest of this tutorial, I won’t include the ```{mermaid} line at the top or the ``` at the end. You need to use these special symbols (called code fencing) to tell Obsidian that it needs to run this chunk through Mermaid.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Saving an argument map as a PDF file\nObsidian doesn’t have a built-in way to generate image files or Word docx files. (I haven’t tested it, but it looks like the plugin Obsidian Pandoc can do this for you.) But it can generate PDF files, which will work just fine for our class.\nTo export a note as PDF, click on the three dots icon (upper right) to open the More Options menu. Export to PDF is at the bottom. After clicking the Export to PDF button, a save dialog will pop up. I recommend saving it in the same folder as the argument map itself, so that you can always find them together.\n\n\n2.2.4 Doing more with Obsidian\nFor this class, this is pretty much all you need to know about Obsidian. But it’s much more powerful: you can add formatting (including emphasis, bold, headings, lists), insert images and links, and visualize a folder of notes as a network, without adding any other plugins. There are lots of tutorials for Obsidian online."

The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases. (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nThis argument has one conclusion sentence (in bold) and three premises, in red, blue, and purple. These premises form independent arguments: the first challenges scientific evidence, the second explains benefits of animal agriculture, and the third is about research on the health benefits of eating meat.

In Mermaid, we can do this by writing the “arrow lines” slightly differently: we combine the two premises, P1 & P2, then connect them to an argument label with a triple-dash, and then add an arrow to the conclusion.

    "text": "5.2 Objecting to a premise\nAgain, an objection is an argument whose conclusion is that (a) another argument has a false premise, or (b) another argument’s premises don’t support its conclusion. Let’s start with the first kind of objection, which challenges a premise.\nA premise in an argument is just a claim, like any other, which means it can be supported or opposed with arguments. In her 1973 article “On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion,” the ethicist Mary Anne Warren gave a critique of the pro-life claim that an embryo has a right to life from conception. Here’s my paraphrase of her critique:\n\nAn embryo lacks consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to community, and self-awareness. But only beings with these capacities have a right to life. So an embryo does not have a right to life.\n\nThis argument has two interdependent premises, so we’ll collect them together using the argument label Warren's objection. To color the argument label red, give it the type OL instead of A.\n\n\nShow the code\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you’re reading this, remember that solid/blue indicates support and dashed/red indicates opposition. So Warren’s two premises support (solid blue line) her objection, and the objection opposes (dashed red line) the right-to-life premise. In turn, the right-to-life premise opposes (dashed red line) the conclusion that abortion should be legal.\nAn opposing argument is not much better than mere disagreement (where one side makes a claim and the other side says the opposite, without any arguments). Opposing arguments give us some insight into how each side of a debate thinks about the issue. But objections help us understand what one side thinks of the other side’s arguments. This can lead to deeper insights: What’s the fundamental disagreement between the two sides? Where do they agree? Tracing out a complex debate, using tools like argument maps, might not resolve a controversy, but they can help us understand it better.\nA number of philosophers and other writers, including the ethicist Don Marquis, responded to Warren’s argument by pointing out that coma patients have a right to life, despite lacking the capacities Warren points to.\n\n\nShow the code\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\n\nOMarquis1(\"Coma patients also lack these capacities.\")\nOMarquis2(\"Coma patients have a right to life.\")\n\nOMarquis1 & OMarquis2 --- OLMarquis[Marquis' reply] -.-> OWarren1\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\n\nOMarquis1(\"Coma patients also lack these capacities.\")\nOMarquis2(\"Coma patients have a right to life.\")\n\nOMarquis1 & OMarquis2 --- OLMarquis[Marquis' reply] -.-> OWarren1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarquis’ argument doesn’t deny that an embryo lacks the capacities for consciousness, pain, and so on. Instead he’s criticizing Warren’s claim that only beings with these capacities have a right to life. So his argument is another example of an objection to a premise. Specifically, this kind of objection to a previous objection is called a reply. In philosophy classes, you’ll often be asked to write papers where you present an argument, an objection, and finally a reply to that objection.\nMarquis didn’t just give a reply to Warren’s objection. He offered his own argument for an embryo’s right to life. He calls it the “future-like-ours” argument, because it appeals to the idea that “The future of a standard fetus includes a set of experiences, projects, activities, and such which are identical with the futures of adult human beings and are identical with the futures of young children,” and that a fetus has a right to life because it has the potential for this kind of future. Marquis also argues that this “future-like-ours” view explains why temporary coma patients, at least, have a right to life: because they have the potential to awaken and lead a more-or-less typical adult human life.\n\n\nShow the code\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\n%% Warren's objection to the right-to-life argument\nsubgraph Warren's objection\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\nend\n\n\n%% Marquis' reply to Warren's objection\nsubgraph Marquis' reply\nOMarquis1(\"Coma patients also lack these capacities.\")\nOMarquis2(\"Coma patients have a right to life.\")\n\nOMarquis1 & OMarquis2 --- OLMarquis[Marquis' reply] -.-> OWarren1\nend\n\n\n%% Marquis' future-like-ours account of the right to life\nsubgraph Marquis' future-like-ours account\nPfuture(\"Any being with the potential to \n         lead a future-like-ours has a \n         right to life.\")\n\nPcoma(\"Temporary coma patients have the potential\n       to lead a future-like-ours.\")\nPfuture & Pcoma --- Acoma[Marquis: Coma patient] --> OMarquis2\n\nPembryo(\"An embryo has the potential\n         to lead a future-like-ours.\")\nPfuture & Pembryo --- Aembryo[Marquis: Embryo] --> Oright-to-life\nend\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy)\nPautonomy --> C(Abortion should be legal)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception)\nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\n%% Warren's objection to the right-to-life argument\nsubgraph Warren's objection\nOWarren1(\"Only beings with the capacity for \n     consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, \n     self-motivated activity, the capacity to \n     communicate, and self-awareness have \n     a right to life.\")\nOWarren2(\"An embryo lacks these capacities.\")\n\nOWarren1 & OWarren2 --- OL[Warren's objection] -.-> Oright-to-life\nend\n\n\n%% Marquis' reply to Warren's objection\nsubgraph Marquis' reply\nOMarquis1(\"Coma patients also lack these capacities.\")\nOMarquis2(\"Coma patients have a right to life.\")\n\nOMarquis1 & OMarquis2 --- OLMarquis[Marquis' reply] -.-> OWarren1\nend\n\n\n%% Marquis' future-like-ours account of the right to life\nsubgraph Marquis' future-like-ours account\nPfuture(\"Any being with the potential to \n         lead a future-like-ours has a \n         right to life.\")\n\nPcoma(\"Temporary coma patients have the potential\n       to lead a future-like-ours.\")\nPfuture & Pcoma --- Acoma[Marquis: Coma patient] --> OMarquis2\n\nPembryo(\"An embryo has the potential\n         to lead a future-like-ours.\")\nPfuture & Pembryo --- Aembryo[Marquis: Embryo] --> Oright-to-life\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding boxes using subgraphs\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can draw a box around a section of the debate by putting subgraph [name] at the beginning of the section and end at the end. Check the source code to see how.\n\n\n\nInitially, this map of the debate over abortion might not seem that helpful. We’ve taken a complex moral and political debate, and turned it into a complex diagram.\nBut examining the map does help us understand a few aspects of the debate. First, no one is denying that embryos lack the capacity to feel pain or consciousness or the like. And no one is denying that (typically) embryos have the potential for a future-like-ours.\nSecond, this debate has stepped back from the concrete issue of abortion itself, to focus on the abstract question who has a right to life? The interlocutors give two very different answers to this question — Warren says a right to life requires certain cognitive capacities, Marquis says it’s based on a “future-like-ours” — and there’s no neutral way to determine which answer is right. Abortion proponents have a strong incentive to favor Warren’s account, and abortion opponents have an equally strong incentive to favor Marquis’ account. This is a common feature of philosophical debate, and in my opinion one reason people often find philosophy useless and frustrating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterlocutor\n\n\n\n\n\nA person who takes part in dialogue or conversation.\n\n\n\nBut this abstract philosophical debate can still be useful, for helping us understand the deeper disagreement between abortion defenders and opponents. This is the third point. Anti-abortion advocates, like Marquis, often think of embryos and fetuses as (soon-to-be, more-or-less) infants. They’ll acknowledge that, in the early stages of pregnancy, an embryo or fetus is biologically pretty far off from a newborn. But they emphasize what the embryo or fetus might be like, months or even years later. Pro-choice advocates, like Warren, instead tend to focus on what the embryo or fetus is in itself at that early stage of development, setting aside what it might be like in the future. When they do think about what the embryo might be in the future, they emphasize the effort and risk that pregnant people experience on the way.\nIn her essay “Virtue Theory and Abortion,” the ethicist Rosalind Hursthouse looks at this debate, and acknowledges that both of these perspectives on an embryo/fetus are important.\n\n[T]he premature termination of a pregnancy is, in some sense, the cutting off of a new human life, and thereby … connects with all our thoughts about human life and death, parenthood, and family relationships ….\n[But also, many women] view pregnancy only as eight months of misery, followed by hours if not days of agony and exhaustion, and abortion only as the blessed escape from this prospect[. This point of view] is entirely understandable and does not manifest any lack of serious respect for human life or a shallow attitude to motherhood. (237, 240)\n\nHursthouse goes on to argue that an abstract debate over whether an embryo has a right to life is less useful than a concrete discussion of the many factors — financial, personal, cultural, medical — that play a role in whether someone chooses to carry a pregnancy to term or to have an abortion. Rather than the high-profile pro-choice vs. anti-abortion positions, Hursthouse’s view fits better with the reproductive justice movement, which advocates for legalized abortion but also the need for free, high-quality healthcare and childcare and living wages.\n\nConsider this argument, which we met earlier in Chapter 3:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases. (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nUsing the rules from Chapter 1 of Rulebook for Arguments, develop an objection to one of the premises of this argument, and then a reply to your objection. Present your objection and reply using an argument map."

    "section": "5.3 Objecting to support",
    "text": "5.3 Objecting to support\nThe other way that we can object to an argument is to challenge the support relationship between premises and conclusion. That is, we might accept all of an argument’s premises, but still think that they don’t give a good reason to accept the conclusion. In the rest of this semester, we’ll learn lots of different tools to assess support for different kinds of arguments. For instance, when we talk about generalizations, or arguments by example, we’ll introduce a rule that generalizations need more than one example. A generalization with a single example can have a true premise — this thing did happen in this one particular case — but, because it violates the rule, it doesn’t give much support to the conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStudents often have a lot of trouble with the idea of support. It’s okay if you don’t get it at first. Think of this course as teaching how to recognize how support works for different kinds of arguments.\n\n\nTo illustrate objecting to support, let’s go back to our basic opposition between bodily autonomy and an embryo’s right to life. A pro-life person might agree that bodily autonomy — the right to do what you want with your own body — is important. But, they might continue, not all rights are equally important. Specifically, someone’s right to life takes precedence over other rights. As a nineteenth-century aphorism put it, “My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins.”\nThis objection challenges the pro-choice argument, but it doesn’t challenge the premise of bodily autonomy. Instead it challenges the support, the link, between that premise and the conclusion of legal abortion. In Mermaid, we can represent this by opposing an argument label, rather than a premise. So we’ll add label for the pro-choice “autonomy argument,” then the objection targeting it.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy.)\nPautonomy --- Aautonomy[Autonomy arg.] --> C(Abortion should be legal.)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception.) \nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOprecedence(\"Someone's right to life takes precedence\n             over another person's right to bodily\n             autonomy.\")\nOprecedence & Oright-to-life --- OL[Precedence obj.] -.-> Aautonomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe premise that an embryo has a right to life is playing two roles in this debate. First, on its own, it provides an argument that abortion should not be legal. But also, when combined with the claim about the precedence of a right to life, it gives an objection to the autonomy argument. If an embryo doesn’t have a right to life, then it doesn’t matter if a right to life takes precedence over bodily autonomy. So someone might give a reply to the precedence objection in three ways:\n\nChallenge the premise that an embryo has a right to life.\nChallenge the premise that a right to life takes precedence over bodily autonomy.\nChallenge the support of the precedence objection.\n\nWarren’s objection could be used to take strategy (1). The ethicist Judith Jarvis Thomson took strategy (2) in her 1971 paper “A Defense of Abortion”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomson’s defense of abortion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her paper, Thomson grants (at least for the sake of argument) that an embryo has a right to life. She defense of abortion is to argue that this right to life does not take precedence over bodily autonomy. She introduces a famous thought experiment, in which you’re kidnapped and surgically connected to a world-famous violinist, who’s in a coma and will die if you don’t act as his life support system for the next nine months. The violinist has a right to life, she says, but not a right to the use of your body.\nIn my opinion, Thomson’s argument is based on an excessively strong form of individualism. Later in the paper, in another thought experiment, she imagines that she’s dying in bed, and the actor Henry Fonda is standing in the doorway of her room, just a few feet away. If Fonda walks over and touches her forehead, she’ll be instantly cured of her disease and her life will be saved. She writes:\n\nSuppose he has only to walk across the room, place a hand briefly on my brow-and lo, my life is saved. Then surely he ought to do it, it would be indecent to refuse. Is it to be said “Ah,well, it follows that in this case she has a right to the touch of his hand on her brow, and so it would be an injustice in him to refuse”? … It’s rather a shocking idea that anyone’s rights should fade away and disappear as it gets harder and harder to accord them to him. (61)\n\nIn other words, Thomson says that Fonda morally should do this trivial thing to save her life. But she has no moral (or legal) right to demand that he does so.\nMy objection is that Thomson’s view would undermine any use of taxpayer funds to provide social benefits: public roads, education, clean air and water, shelter, health care, food, and so on. There are people who will die today because of lack of access to shelter or health care. Does justice require that wealthy people be taxed, and those funds use to pay for things like homeless shelters and universal health insurance? I think it does. In other words, vulnerable people do have a right to demand that wealthy people pay for these kinds of things.\n\n\n\nThe third strategy amounts to saying: Okay, at least for the sake of argument, I’ll agree that an embryo has a right to life; and a right to life takes precedence over a right to bodily autonomy. But even then the precedence objection doesn’t work. Those premises aren’t enough to conclude that the bodily autonomy argument is flawed.\nOne way to take this third strategy is to make a distinction between killing someone and letting them die. Many people would say there’s a difference between letting a young child drown in a bathtub and actively holding them underwater until they drown. One version of this distinction is in terms of intentions: if the child managed to save themselves, you wouldn’t reach down and push them back under. Someone might go on to argue that letting someone die doesn’t violate their right to life — it was sort of an accident or unintended consequence — and that abortion is letting an embryo die — if the embryo someone managed to survive the procedure, you wouldn’t actively try to kill it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe drowning children example comes from a paper by the ethicist James Rachels. Rachels’ point was to challenge the distinction: he claims that there’s actually no morally significant difference between these two cases.\n\n\nThis reply to the precedence objection again targets the support of the argument. The objection can agree that the right to life takes precedence over bodily autonomy. But, they claim, the right to life isn’t violated in abortion, because abortion is letting an embryo die rather than killing it.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n\nPautonomy(Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy.)\nPautonomy --- Aautonomy[Autonomy arg.] --> C(Abortion should be legal.)\n\nOright-to-life(An embryo has a right to life from conception.) \nOright-to-life -.-> C\n\nOprecedence(\"Someone's right to life takes precedence\n             over another person's right to bodily\n             autonomy.\")\nOprecedence & Oright-to-life --- OLprecedence[Precedence obj.] -.-> Aautonomy\n\nOkilling-die(\"Unlike killing, letting someone die \n              does not violate their right to life.\")\nOabortion-die(\"Abortion is letting an embryo die, \n               not killing it\")\nOkilling-die & Oabortion-die --- OL[Killing vs.\\nletting die] -.-> OLprecedence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart here\n<Killing vs. letting die reply>\n\n(1) [killing vs. letting die]: Unlike killing, letting someone die does not violate their right to life\n(2) [abortion is letting die]: Abortion is letting an embryo die, not killing it\n----\n(3) [C]: Abortion does not violate an embryo's right to life\n    -> <Precedence objection>\nWhile this is a useful example for showing how we represent objections and replies in argument maps, I don’t think it’s a very compelling reply to the objection. In my opinion, both premises have problems. First, many homeless people in our society die of exposure and treatable diseases. This is letting them die — we don’t actively hunt down homeless people who survive these challenges — but denying them access to housing and health care does, I think, violate their right to life. Second, it’s not clear to me what the difference is supposed to be between ending a pregnancy and ending the life of the embryo or fetus involved in that pregnancy, i.e., killing it. It seems to me like these are just two ways of describing the same action.\n\nExpand the argument map above to include my two objections to the killing vs. letting die reply. Are these objections to support or objections to premises?"

    "text": "6.2 The “not all feedstocks” objection\nMadrigal responds by questioning the premise of the carbon emissions argument.\n\nAM: So is that true for all feedstocks or just certain of these renewable feedstocks? Like we know the profile is kind of different if it’s like virgin palm oil versus like recycled vegetable oil or something like that?\n\nWe can paraphrase this question as a declarative statement: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits. This is a generalization or argument by example, supported by the example of virgin palm oil. Because this argument is challenging a premise of the carbon emissions argument, it’s an objection to that argument. We’ll give it an argument label, the not all feedstocks objection, to highlight the sub-debate that develops around this objection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe link is to a page by an organization called the International Council on Clean Transportation. Using the SIFT method, you should ask yourself: What is this organization? Who are they, who funds them, and what’s their agenda? The organization has a Wikipedia page, which indicates that it’s funded by an organization whose “mission is to slow global warming”. But not much more information. A Google Search for “palm oil carbon emissions” turns up a number of other sources making similar claims about high carbon emissions from palm oil.\n\n\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n    \n[not all feedstocks]: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits.\n    +> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n      -> [carbon emissions]\n\n[virgin palm oil]: Virgin palm oil does not have these pollution benefits.\n    +> [not all feedstocks]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nnot all feedstocks\nNot all renewable feedstocks have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn5\n\nNot all feedstocks objection\n\n\n\nn3->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nvirgin palm oil\nVirgin palm oil does not have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn4->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn5->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRS: We do not support any kinds of feedstocks, that are purposely grown such as palm that are meant to convert forests or other kinds of lands to produce renewable diesel. So there are some protections already built in. Because if you’re converting that land, you’re losing carbon and you don’t get a good benefit from that from a climate perspective.\n\nThis is a concession: RS agrees that the pollution argument only applies to things like recycled vegetable oil, not virgin palm oil. It amounts to an objection to the validity of the “not all feedstocks” argument: its premise (not all feedstocks) doesn’t support it’s conclusion (not-carbon emissions) because carbon emissions isn’t supposed to apply to absolutely all possible feedstocks.

So this is an independent argument. It’s not an objection to the pollution arguments, because it doesn’t challenge their premises or their support for the conclusion.
