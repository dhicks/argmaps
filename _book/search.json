    "text": "Argdown is software designed to turn pieces of text into argument maps, visual representations of the structure of an argument or debate. This page has instructions for two ways of setting up this software: you can use a website called the Argdown Sandbox, or you can download and install Argdown on your computer, along with notetaking software called Obsidian.\nBoth options for using Argdown are completely free, and either one will work to generate argument maps for this course. The Argdown Sandbox doesn’t require any setup — you just open up a website and start typing — but doesn’t have a simple way to save your work. Using Argdown with Obsidian requires you to download and install some software on your computer. It’s easy to use Obsidian to save your argument maps; but the software hasn’t been vetted by our campus IT office. That means there’s a security risk installing this software. Do not store any sensitive information in Obsidian."

    "text": "2.1 Using the Argdown Sandbox\nUsing the Argdown Sandbox is simple: simply open a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/, and you should see the same thing as Figure 2.1. Since you’ll be creating argument maps pretty regularly in this class, you’ll probably want to bookmark that link.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Argdown Sandbox: https://argdown.org/sandbox/\n\n\nMost of the Sandbox is taken up by the text pane (left) and preview pane (right). Notice that you can’t click or do anything in the preview pane. But click anywhere in the text pane, hit ⌘+a (Control+a on Windows) to select all, then hit backspace or delete to clear out the demo text. Type the following, including at least two spaces or a tab at the start of the second line:\nI'm a premise \n  +> I'm a conclusion\nAt the very top-right, there’s a list of rendering options (methods for representing the text in the text pane): HTML, Map, and JSON, then two outgoing links for Documentation (the Argdown homepage) and the Argdown source code on GitHub.\nIf you’re in HTML mode, you should see something like Figure 2.2 in the preview pane.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox in HTML mode\n\n\nTo view the argument map itself, select Map mode in the upper-right, then click Dagre D3 Map at the top of the preview pane. The whole thing should look like Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox with Dagre D3 Map mode\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Saving your work in the Argdown Sandbox\nThe Argdown Sandbox has no way to save your work. It’s meant to be a quick preview of what Argdown can do, not a space for you to regularly do important work. You’ll need to manually save your work by copying and pasting to a file on your computer.\nBefore you save your work for the first time, create a designated folder for all of the work for this course. I’m going to call this the course folder. The Documents folder on your computer is a good place to do this. If you don’t know how to find your Documents folder and create a new folder there, your instructor and TA can help.\nOnce you’ve created the course folder, follow these steps to save a new argument map. Try them out with the example you typed in to the text pane a few minutes ago.\n\nOpen the app TextEdit (on a Mac) or Notepad (on Windows).[^You can use any plaintext editor of your choice. But something like Microsoft Word won’t work.]\nCreate a new file, and copy and paste the argument map text from the Argdown Sandbox into the new file.\nOn a Mac: You may need to go to Format -> Make Plain Text. See Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Changing TextEdit to plaintext mode\n\n\nHit ⌘+s (Mac) or Control+s (Windows) to bring up the save dialog.\n\nMake sure you’re saving to the course folder.\nMake sure the file type is set to “plain text” or “txt”.\n\n\n\nWhen you want to open up a saved argument map, you’ll need to follow these steps.\n\nFind the argument map file in the course folder, and open it with your text editor.\n\nSelect the entire argument map text, then copy it.\nOpen the Argdown Sandbox by navigating a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/.\nSelect the example text in the text pane, then paste the argument map text.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Saving an image file from the Argdown Sandbox\nAfter creating an argument map in the Argdown Sandbox, you can download an image file by clicking on png near the upper-right. Hit “Create PNG” in the dialog box, and you’ll automatically download an image file named map.png. Move this to the course folder, and give it the same name as the corresponding text file."

    "text": "Let’s start with a simple argument for a campus mask mandate:\n\nMasks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19. So our campus should have a mask mandate.\n\nThis argument has a single premise (in blue) and a conclusion (in green; it has the indicator word so. To start mapping out this argument, we start with the conclusion. Click > Details for instructions on how to enter this into Argdown.\n\nEither (a) open up the Argdown Sandbox or (b) make a new blank file in your text editor.\n\nType in the text in typerwriter font. Click on the HTML tab in the upper-right to view the result.\n\nType in the text in typewriter font. Save the file. On the command line, type argdown html <file>; the result will be in the html folder.\n\n\n[mandate]: our campus should have a mask mandate\nWe give the conclusion a title, [abortion], so that we can construct multiple arguments that involve it without having to type and retype it again and again.\nNext we’ll add the premise, and indicate that it supports the conclusion. Like the conclusion, we give the premise a name so that we can refer back to it again. Markdown has a few different ways of indicating support relationships. All of the following are equivalent:\n[mandate]: Our campus should have a mask mandate. \n\n[masks effective]: Masks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19.\n    +> [mandate]\n    \n[mandate]\n    <+ [masks effective]\n\n[mandate] \n    + [masks effective] \nThe first version has the premise, followed by the conclusion. The second and third start with the conclusion, then give the premise. Notice that the direction of the arrow is reversed between the first and second versions. Support goes from the premise, to the conclusion. The third version can be useful for showing how an conclusion can be supported by multiple independent arguments; more on that later.\nTo generate visual argument maps, we use exactly the same text representation but give Argdown slightly different instructions. Click on > Details. You result should be the same as the image below.\n\nOn the Argdown Sandbox, click Map in the upper-right. Viz.js Map should be highlighted just below where you clicked. You might need to click on Dagre D3 Map to view the argument map. To export it, click on the svg or png buttons just to the right.\nOn the command line, type argdown map <file> to generate a static PDF file image, or argdown web-component <file> to generate an interactive HTML file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry each version of the argument separately. Confirm that the argument maps are identical in each case.\nWhat happens if you reverse one of the arrows?\nConstruct a map for the following argument:\n\n\nBikes, scooters, and the bus all have a lower carbon footprint than individual cars. So campus should encourage people to take bikes, scooters, and the bus."

    "text": "3.2 Independent arguments for the same conclusion\nConsider the following passage:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.  (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nThis argument has one conclusion sentence (in bold) and three premises, in red, blue, and purple. These premises form independent arguments: the first challenges scientific evidence, the second explains benefits of animal agriculture, and the third is about research on the health benefits of eating meat. Because they’re talking about different aspects of the debate over animal agriculture, these arguments are independent of each other. Here’s how we can represent these three independent arguments in an argument map.\n\nClick on “Source” to view the Argdown source code.\n\n[not bad for enviro or people]: Animal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. \n\n[bad science]: The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n[unusuable land]: Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n    \n[meat healthy]: New scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nnot bad for enviro or people\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the\n environment and it is not bad for\n people. \n\n\n\nn1\n\nbad science\nThe so-called scientific studies\n purporting to show that animals are\n bad for the environment have been\n repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nunusuable land\nRuminant animals, like cattle and\n sheep, are among the most sustainable\n food production systems on Earth,\n taking unusable land and waste\n products from vegetable and grain\n production, and turning it into\n healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nmeat healthy\nNew scientific research is coming out\n showing that meat is extremely good\n for our health, and that a high-meat\n diet free of processed foods can\n actually reverse all kinds of chronic\n diseases.\n\n\n\nn3->n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might have occurred to you that there are actually two conclusions in this argument:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment.\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for people.\n\nDifferent arguments support different conclusions.
