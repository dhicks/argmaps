    "text": "Argdown is software designed to turn pieces of text into argument maps, visual representations of the structure of an argument or debate. This page has instructions for two ways of setting up this software: you can use a website called the Argdown Sandbox, or you can download and install Argdown on your computer, along with notetaking software called Obsidian.\nBoth options for using Argdown are completely free, and either one will work to generate argument maps for this course. The Argdown Sandbox doesn’t require any setup — you just open up a website and start typing — but doesn’t have a simple way to save your work. Using Argdown with Obsidian requires you to download and install some software on your computer. It’s easy to use Obsidian to save your argument maps; but the software hasn’t been vetted by our campus IT office. That means there’s a security risk installing this software. Do not store any sensitive information in Obsidian."

    "text": "2.1 Using the Argdown Sandbox\nUsing the Argdown Sandbox is simple: simply open a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/, and you should see the same thing as Figure 2.1. Since you’ll be creating argument maps pretty regularly in this class, you’ll probably want to bookmark that link.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Argdown Sandbox: https://argdown.org/sandbox/\n\n\nMost of the Sandbox is taken up by the text pane (left) and preview pane (right). Notice that you can’t click or do anything in the preview pane. But click anywhere in the text pane, hit ⌘+a (Control+a on Windows) to select all, then hit backspace or delete to clear out the demo text. Type the following, including at least two spaces or a tab at the start of the second line:\nI'm a premise \n  +> I'm a conclusion\nAt the very top-right, there’s a list of rendering options (methods for representing the text in the text pane): HTML, Map, and JSON, then two outgoing links for Documentation (the Argdown homepage) and the Argdown source code on GitHub.\nIf you’re in HTML mode, you should see something like Figure 2.2 in the preview pane.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox in HTML mode\n\n\nTo view the argument map itself, select Map mode in the upper-right, then click Dagre D3 Map at the top of the preview pane. The whole thing should look like Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Example output of the Argdown Sandbox with Dagre D3 Map mode\n\n\n\n2.1.1 How your computer is organized\nIf you use your computer primarily through free-text search boxes — just type in a word or phrase and scroll through the results — you might not be used to thinking about how your computer is actually organized. One side effect of Argdown is that you’ll need to be deliberate about where your save your argument maps.\nYour computer is organized like a physical filing cabinet, with drawers containing folders containing (paper) files. (Except the drawers are also called folders, and you can have folders inside of folders inside of folders inside of folders.) Every file on your computer lives in its particular folder, and everything containing files is a folder. This includes your desktop, which is a representation of a special folder tied to your user account on your computer. Apps are also collections of files organized together into folders; installing an app means copying that folder structure into certain places on your device and configuring the operating system to interact with the app’s files. All computers are organized like this, including your phone, a smartwatch, an Alexa or Siri, a Ring doorbell, etc.\nFigure 2.4 shows you how I keep all the different files for our class organized into a collection of folders, as viewed using Mac OS’s Finder app in column mode. (Windows has a similar app called File Explorer.) The Teaching folder contains everything related to all of the classes I’ve taught, past and present. critical reasoning is dedicated to this specific class, with separate folders for each year. Inside I have further folders, for things like quizzes, the syllabus, writing assignments, and final grades. The slides folder contains all of the lecture slides. At the bottom of the window, I have Finder configured to show the path, or the location of the particular folder or file being highlighted. The path starts with my laptop’s hard drive (this might look like C: on Windows), then the Users folder. The Users folder contains files specific to each account on this computer. There’s only one user account on my laptop, danhicks, but some systems — like our campus email server — will have thousands of user accounts. Imagine how many user folders must be in the Gmail and Facebook servers.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Files organized into folders, as viewed by Mac OS’s Finder in column mode\n\n\nInside my user folder, danhicks, is a specific folder that I sync to the cloud using Google Drive. All of my teaching files are contained in this folder, so that they’re synced automatically. I also backup my files to an external hard drive using the Mac app Time Machine, plus the cloud service Backblaze. Triple protection in case something happens to my computer! (The “cloud” is really just physical computers located somewhere else, usually in giant warehouse-like buildings near cheap sources of electricity.)\nThanks to fast search software, we’ve gotten used to not having to interact with files and folder organization directly in a lot of cases. I don’t need to know exactly where a certain form is located on the campus website; a web search will turn it up in a few seconds. But deliberately organizing your own files into folders is important. For one thing, it makes it much easier to find related files, especially files with similar names or content. I’ve taught a lot of classes over the last 15+ years. So if I’m looking for the syllabus for the Fall 2020 version of Critical Reasoning, a search for syllabus is going to turn up a lot of results. It’s much faster to go to the folder for Critical Reasoning, then Fall 2020, and then the syllabus folder. Then, if I’m looking at that syllabus and want to look up the writing assignment I used in that course, I don’t need to remember exactly what I called the writing assignment file or what keywords might bring it up. I just click a couple of times to open the folder for the writing assignment.\nThere’s also a technical reason for not leaving all of your files on your desktop. Your computer assumes that files on your desktop are important and frequently accessed. So it keeps a kind of pre-loaded copy of the file in memory, so that it can open the file quickly whenever you might need it. Having hundreds or even thousands of files on your desktop can seriously slow down your computer.\n\n\n2.1.2 Saving your work in the Argdown Sandbox\nThe Argdown Sandbox has no way to save your work. It’s meant to be a quick preview of what Argdown can do, not a space for you to regularly do important work. You’ll need to manually save your work by copying and pasting to a file on your computer.\nBefore you save your work for the first time, create a designated folder for all of the work for this course. I’m going to call this the course folder. The Documents folder on your computer is a good place to do this. If you don’t know how to find your Documents folder and create a new folder there, your instructor and TA can help.\nOnce you’ve created the course folder, follow these steps to save a new argument map. Try them out with the example you typed in to the text pane a few minutes ago.\n\nOpen the app TextEdit (on a Mac) or Notepad (on Windows).1\nCreate a new file, and copy and paste the argument map text from the Argdown Sandbox into the new file.\nOn a Mac: You may need to go to Format -> Make Plain Text. See Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Changing TextEdit to plaintext mode\n\n\nHit ⌘+s (Mac) or Control+s (Windows) to bring up the save dialog.\n\nMake sure you’re saving to the course folder.\nMake sure the file type is set to “plain text” or “txt”.\n\n\n\nWhen you want to open up a saved argument map, you’ll need to follow these steps.\n\nFind the argument map file in the course folder, and open it with your text editor.\n\nSelect the entire argument map text, then copy it.\nOpen the Argdown Sandbox by navigating a web browser to https://argdown.org/sandbox/.\nSelect the example text in the text pane, then paste the argument map text.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Saving an image file from the Argdown Sandbox\nAfter creating an argument map in the Argdown Sandbox, you can download an image file by clicking on png near the upper-right. Hit “Create PNG” in the dialog box, and you’ll automatically download an image file named map.png. Move this to the course folder, and give it the same name as the corresponding text file."

    "section": "2.2 Using Argdown with Obsidian",
    "text": "2.2 Using Argdown with Obsidian\nObsidian is notetaking and knowledge base software. If you’ve used the website Notion, it’s somewhat similar. We can use Obsidian with Argdown using a community-developed plugin. Both Obsidian and the Argdown plugin are entirely free. Creating argument maps is just a little more complicated than using the Argdown Sandbox, but as an app on your computer it’s simple to save and open argument maps.\nIf you’re going with this option, remember that OIT has not vetted Obsidian for security and privacy. Be sure not to store any sensitive information in Obsidian.\n\n2.2.1 Installing Obsidian and the Argdown plugin\nTo setup and install Obsidian and the Argdown plugin, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate a web browser to https://obsidian.md/ and click the download link for your operating system. After the download finishes, run the installer.\n\nOpen Obsidian. It should show you the “open vault” window in Figure 2.6.\n\nIf you already created a course folder, choose “Open folder as vault,” and select your course folder as an Obsidian vault. This won’t mess up your existing files in any way; Obsidian plays nicely with other apps.\n\nIf you haven’t already created a course folder, choose “Create new vault.” Give your vault/course folder a name like “Critical Reasoning” and set its location to be something like your Documents folder.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Obsidian’s “open vault” window\n\n\nNavigate a browser to https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=argdown. (Or, from the Obsidian homepage, click “Plugins” and then type argdown into the search box.) Click the “Open in Obsidian” link. You might need to tell your web browser to use Obsidian for the link.\n\nObsidian should open and display information about the plugin. See Figure 2.7. Click “Install.”\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Installing the Argdown plugin for Obsidian\n\n\nAfter installation, in Obsidian, click on the gear icon (lower-left) to open Settings. Look for Community Plugins on the left, then the “Installed plugins” section in the main pane. Find the Argdown plugin and click the toggle to activate it.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Creating an argument map in Obsidian\nOnce the Argdown plugin is installed and activated, you can add an argument map to any Obsidian note. Your first time through, follow these steps.\n\nCreate a new note (you can click the “New Note” icon on the upper-left, or hit ⌘+n on a Mac or Control-N on Windows).\n\n(Optional) Give the note a name, like “first argument map.” Obsidian automatically saves any changes to your files.\n\nType the following:\n```argdown\nI'm a premise \n   +> I'm a conclusion\n```\nClick on the glasses icon in the upper-right to switch Obsidian into reading mode. This will prompt the Argdown plugin to render the argument map, turning it into an interactive widget like the Argdown Sandbox. See Figure 2.8. If you see text instead of the map, click the “Map” button.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Rendered argument map in Obsidian\n\n\n\nImportant: In the rest of this tutorial, I won’t include the ```argdown line at the top or the ``` at the end. You need to use these special symbols (called code fencing) to tell Obsidian that it needs to run the argument map through Argdown.\n\n\n2.2.3 Saving an argument map as a PDF file\nObsidian doesn’t have a built-in way to generate image files or Word docx files. (I haven’t tested it, but it looks like the plugin Obsidian Pandoc can do this for you.) But it can generate PDF files, which will work just fine for our class.\nTo export a note as PDF, click on the three dots icon (upper right) to open the More Options menu. Export to PDF is at the bottom. After clicking the Export to PDF button, a save dialog will pop up. I recommend saving it in the same folder as the argument map itself, so that you can always find them together.\n\n\n2.2.4 Doing more with Obsidian\nFor this class, this is pretty much all you need to know about Obsidian. But it’s much more powerful: you can add formatting (including emphasis, bold, headings, lists), insert images and links, and visualize a folder of notes as a network, without adding any other plugins. There are lots of tutorials for Obsidian online."

    "text": "Let’s start with a simple argument for a campus mask mandate:\n\nMasks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19. So our campus should have a mask mandate.\n\nThis argument has a single premise (in blue) and a conclusion (in green; it has the indicator word so. To start mapping out this argument, we start with the conclusion. Enter this into either the Argdown Sandbox or Obsidian.\n[mandate]: our campus should have a mask mandate\nWe give the conclusion a title, [mandate], so that we can construct multiple arguments that involve it without having to type and retype it again and again.\nNext we’ll add the premise, and indicate that it supports the conclusion. Like the conclusion, we give the premise a name so that we can refer back to it again. Argdown has a few different ways of indicating support relationships. All of the following are equivalent:\n[mandate]: Our campus should have a mask mandate. \n\n[masks effective]: Masks are effective at preventing people from spreading Covid-19.\n    +> [mandate]\n    \n[mandate]\n    <+ [masks effective]\n\n[mandate] \n    + [masks effective] \nThe first version has the premise, followed by the conclusion. The second and third start with the conclusion, then give the premise. Notice that the direction of the arrow is reversed between the first and second versions. Support always goes from the premise and to the conclusion. The third version can be useful for showing how an conclusion can be supported by multiple independent arguments; more on that later. Whichever way you write out the argument in Argdown, you should see this when you visualize it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry each version of the argument separately. Confirm that the argument maps are identical in each case.\nWhat happens if you reverse one of the arrows?\nConstruct a map for the following argument:\n\n\nBikes, scooters, and the bus all have a lower carbon footprint than individual cars. So campus should encourage people to take bikes, scooters, and the bus."

    "text": "3.2 Independent arguments for the same conclusion\nConsider the following passage:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods. Furthermore, new scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.  (Adapted from Rulebook for Arguments, Third Edition, pp36-37)\n\nThis argument has one conclusion sentence (in bold) and three premises, in red, blue, and purple. These premises form independent arguments: the first challenges scientific evidence, the second explains benefits of animal agriculture, and the third is about research on the health benefits of eating meat. Because they’re talking about different aspects of the debate over animal agriculture, these arguments are independent of each other. Here’s how we can represent these three independent arguments in an argument map.\n\nMost of the argument maps in this tutorial will be interactive. You can click on the Source button to view the underlying Argdown code.\n\n\n[not bad for enviro or people]: Animal agriculture is not bad for the environment and it is not bad for people. \n\n[bad science]: The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n[unusuable land]: Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n    \n[meat healthy]: New scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.\n    +> [not bad for enviro or people]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nnot bad for enviro or people\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the\n environment and it is not bad for\n people. \n\n\n\nn1\n\nbad science\nThe so-called scientific studies\n purporting to show that animals are\n bad for the environment have been\n repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nunusuable land\nRuminant animals, like cattle and\n sheep, are among the most sustainable\n food production systems on Earth,\n taking unusable land and waste\n products from vegetable and grain\n production, and turning it into\n healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nmeat healthy\nNew scientific research is coming out\n showing that meat is extremely good\n for our health, and that a high-meat\n diet free of processed foods can\n actually reverse all kinds of chronic\n diseases.\n\n\n\nn3->n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might have occurred to you that there are actually two conclusions in this argument:\n\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the environment.\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for people.\n\nDifferent arguments support different conclusions. We can modify the Argdown source code, separating the conclusions and indicating which arguments support which conclusion.\n\n[not bad for enviro]: Animal agriculture is not bad for the environment. \n\n[not bad for people]: Animal agriculture is not bad for people. \n\n\n[bad science]: The so-called scientific studies purporting to show that animals are bad for the environment have been repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n    +> [not bad for enviro]\n\n[unusuable land]: Ruminant animals, like cattle and sheep, are among the most sustainable food production systems on Earth, taking unusable land and waste products from vegetable and grain production, and turning it into healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n    +> [not bad for enviro]\n    +> [not bad for people]\n    \n[meat healthy]: New scientific research is coming out showing that meat is extremely good for our health, and that a high-meat diet free of processed foods can actually reverse all kinds of chronic diseases.\n    +> [not bad for people]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nnot bad for enviro\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for the\n environment. \n\n\n\nn1\n\nnot bad for people\nAnimal agriculture is not bad for\n people. \n\n\n\nn2\n\nbad science\nThe so-called scientific studies\n purporting to show that animals are\n bad for the environment have been\n repeatedly shown to be flawed. \n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nunusuable land\nRuminant animals, like cattle and\n sheep, are among the most sustainable\n food production systems on Earth,\n taking unusable land and waste\n products from vegetable and grain\n production, and turning it into\n healthy, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\n\nn3->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3->n1\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nmeat healthy\nNew scientific research is coming out\n showing that meat is extremely good\n for our health, and that a high-meat\n diet free of processed foods can\n actually reverse all kinds of chronic\n diseases.\n\n\n\nn4->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of putting each claim of an argument in its own box. The premise meat healthy isn’t an argument for the not bad for enviro conclusion; it’s only making claims about the health effects of eating meat. And someone might present an objection to the unusuable land premise without addressing the other two, independent arguments.\n\n\nConstruct a map of the following argument:\n\n\nEating animals is wrong for a variety of reasons. First, many animals are sentient creatures that have thoughts and emotions. Second, we should not cause animals to suffer if we don’t need to. Finally, raising animals for food uses resources, like grain, that could be used to feed hungry people around the world."

To establish that I should get an A, we need to establish both the rule that someone needs 10/12 assignments to get an A, and that I satisfied this requirement. We need a way to visually group these premises together in the argument map.\nTo start, let’s arrange the argument in premise-conclusion form.\n(1) If a student completes 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class, they'll get an A. \n(2) I completed 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class. \n----\n(3) [get an A]: I should get an A. \nNote: Argdown only understands premise-conclusion form if you put the numbers in parentheses and four hyphens separating the conclusion.\nIf you put this into Argdown, you’ll get a rather odd result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the premises? By default, Argdown only displays labeled claims in premise-conclusion arguments. You can display all the claims by labeling them. If you’re not feeling creative, just number the claims.\n(1) [P1]: If a student completes 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class, they'll get an A. \n(2) [P2]: I completed 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class. \n----\n(3) [C]: I should get an A. \nAlternatively, copy-and-paste the following at the top of your map’s definition. Numbering the premises will probably be less tedious.1\n===\nselection:\n  statementSelectionMode: all\n===\n\n(1) If a student completes 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class, they'll get an A. \n(2) I completed 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class. \n----\n(3) [get an A]: I should get an A. \n===\nselection:\n  statementSelectionMode: all\n===\n\n(1) If a student completes 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class, they'll get an A. \n(2) I completed 10 of the 12 weekly assignments for this class. \n----\n(3) [get an A]: I should get an A. \n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nIf a student completes 10 of the 12\n weekly assignments for this class,\n they'll get an A. \n\n\n\nn3\n\nUntitled 1\n\n\n\nn0->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn1\n\nI completed 10 of the 12 weekly\n assignments for this class. \n\n\n\nn1->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nget an A\nI should get an A. \n\n\n\nn3->n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow for that “Untitled 1” box.

We can represent both opposing arguments and objections in Argdown, which enables us to represent complex debates."

In other words, refineries would create diesel from plant-based materials instead of fossil fuels. This debate happened in the first six minutes of an episode of Forum, a daily news and call-in show on KQED in the Bay Area. The episode aired May 2, 2022, and you can listen to it here. The transcript below was generated using Otter.ai voice recognition. It’s been edited to correct errors and for brevity. The example shows how even complex debates can be represented visually using argument maps.\nAlexis Madrigal, Forum host: Refineries are massive, expensive, complex machines that produce the transportation fuels that just about everyone still uses ….

    "text": "6.1 The pollution argument\nThe first guest on the program is Rajinder Sahota, an official at the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which regulates air pollution in the state. Sahota is on the show as the primary proponent of the biofuels proposal, and Madrigal asks her to make the basic pro-biofuels argument:\nAM: So first things first, I kind of want to get to the pro case. Like why the refinery should do this. First, from your perspective, what are the benefits of switching to these renewable feedstocks?\nRajinder Sahota: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective. They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state. And so there are both air quality benefits and climate benefits of moving away from the production and use of petroleum fuels to renewable diesel.\nSahota’s giving two different arguments about the pollution benefits of switching to biofuels: lower carbon emissions and lower emissions of PM (particulate matter). These premises are independent: if we drop one, the other premise still provides support for the conclusion.\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0"

    "text": "6.2 The “not all feedstocks” objection\nMadrigal responds by questioning the premise of the carbon emissions argument.\nAM: So is that true for all feedstocks or just certain of these renewable feedstocks? Like we know the profile is kind of different if it’s like virgin palm oil versus like recycled vegetable oil or something like that?\nWe can restate this question as a declarative statement: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits. This is a generalization or argument by example, supported by the example of virgin palm oil1. Because this argument is challenging a premise of the carbon emissions argument, it’s an objection to that argument. We’ll give it an argument label, the not all feedstocks objection, to highlight the sub-debate that develops around this objection.\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n    \n[not all feedstocks]: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits.\n    +> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n      -> [carbon emissions]\n\n[virgin palm oil]: Virgin palm oil does not have these pollution benefits.\n    +> [not all feedstocks]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nnot all feedstocks\nNot all renewable feedstocks have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn5\n\nNot all feedstocks objection\n\n\n\nn3->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nvirgin palm oil\nVirgin palm oil does not have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn4->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn5->n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRS: We do not support any kinds of feedstocks, that are purposely grown such as palm that are meant to convert forests or other kinds of lands to produce renewable diesel. So there are some protections already built in. Because if you’re converting that land, you’re losing carbon and you don’t get a good benefit from that from a climate perspective.\nThis is a concession: RS agrees that the pollution argument only applies to things like recycled vegetable oil, not virgin palm oil. It amounts to an objection to the validity of the “not all feedstocks” argument: its premise (not all feedstocks) doesn’t support it’s conclusion (not-carbon emissions) because carbon emissions isn’t supposed to apply to absolutely all possible feedstocks.

And so there’s a built in mechanism in that program that warrants there to be less carbon from the production, transport and use of these fuels.\nThis objection (which is a reply to a reply to a objection to the carbon emissions argument, if I’m counting right) targets the feedstock regulation premise, so we don’t need to add yet another argument label.\n[biofuels]: Oil refineries in the Bay Area should switch to processing renewable feedstocks to create biofuels.  \n\n[carbon emissions]: The renewable feedstocks have a much lower carbon intensity than traditional petroleum fuels, which means that they emit less carbon into the atmosphere, which is really good from a climate perspective.\n    +> [biofuels]\n\n[pm emissions]: They also have less pm emissions, which are cancer causing pollutants that causes all sorts of cancer and other health issues as that fuel is combusted in trucks and other vehicles that move up and down the state.\n    +> [biofuels]\n    \n[not all feedstocks]: Not all renewable feedstocks have these pollution benefits.\n    +> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n      -> [carbon emissions]\n\n[virgin palm oil]: Virgin palm oil does not have these pollution benefits.\n    +> [not all feedstocks]\n\n[CARB doesn't support]: CARB doesn't support refineries using feedstocks like virgin palm oil.\n    +> <CARB doesn't support reply>\n        -> <Not all feedstocks objection>\n\n[feedstock regulation]: CARB cannot control what feedstocks the refineries use.\n    -> <CARB doesn't support reply>\n    \n[LCFS]: The low carbon fuel standard will require refineries to only use feedstocks with lower carbon emissions\n    -> [feedstock regulation]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nbiofuels\nOil refineries in the Bay Area should\n switch to processing renewable\n feedstocks to create biofuels. \n\n\n\nn1\n\ncarbon emissions\nThe renewable feedstocks have a much\n lower carbon intensity than\n traditional petroleum fuels, which\n means that they emit less carbon into\n the atmosphere, which is really good\n from a climate perspective.\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\npm emissions\nThey also have less pm emissions, which\n are cancer causing pollutants that\n causes all sorts of cancer and other\n health issues as that fuel is\n combusted in trucks and other vehicles\n that move up and down the state.\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nnot all feedstocks\nNot all renewable feedstocks have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn8\n\nNot all feedstocks objection\n\n\n\nn3->n8\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nvirgin palm oil\nVirgin palm oil does not have these\n pollution benefits.\n\n\n\nn4->n3\n\n\n\n\n\nn5\n\nCARB doesn't support\nCARB doesn't support refineries using\n feedstocks like virgin palm oil.\n\n\n\nn9\n\nCARB doesn't support reply\n\n\n\nn5->n9\n\n\n\n\n\nn6\n\nfeedstock regulation\nCARB cannot control what feedstocks the\n refineries use.\n\n\n\nn6->n9\n\n\n\n\n\nn7\n\nLCFS\nThe low carbon fuel standard will\n require refineries to only use\n feedstocks with lower carbon emissions\n\n\n\nn7->n6\n\n\n\n\n\nn8->n1\n\n\n\n\n\nn9->n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, notice how far the debate has gotten from the question of whether refineries should switch to biofuels or even the idea that renewable feedstocks will have lower carbon emissions.

So this is an independent argument. It’s not an objection to the pollution arguments, because it doesn’t challenge their premises or their support for the conclusion.

    "text": "5.2 Objecting to a premise\nAgain, an objection is an argument whose conclusion is that (a) another argument has a false premise, or (b) another argument’s premises don’t support its conclusion. Let’s start with the first kind of objection, which targets a premise.\nA premise in an argument is just a claim, like any other, which means it can be supported or opposed with arguments. In her 1973 article “On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion,” the ethicist Mary Anne Warren gave a critique of the pro-life claim that an embryo has a right to life from conception. Here’s my paraphrase of her critique:\n\nAn embryo lacks consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to community, and self-awareness. But only beings with these capacities have a right to life. So an embryo does not have a right to life.\n\nThis argument has two interdependent premises, so we use premise-conclusion form, as in the previous section. Remember to label the premises of Warren’s argument. Check the source code to see how to tell Argdown that the conclusion challenges the right-to-life premise.\n[abortion]: Abortion should be legal\n\n[bodily autonomy]: Everyone has a right to bodily autonomy\n    +> [abortion]\n    \n[right to life]: An embryo has a right to life from conception\n    -> [abortion]\n    \n<Warren's objection>\n\n(1) [W1]: An embryo lacks consciousness, the capacity to feel pain, self-motivated activity, the capacity to community, and self-awareness.\n(2) [W2]: Only beings with these capacities have a right to life\n----\n(3) \n    -> [right to life]\n\n\n\n\nArgument Map\n\n\nn0\n\nabortion\nAbortion should be legal\n\n\n\nn1\n\nbodily autonomy\nEveryone has a right to bodily autonomy\n\n\n\nn1->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn2\n\nright to life\nAn embryo has a right to life from\n conception\n\n\n\nn2->n0\n\n\n\n\n\nn3\n\nW1\nAn embryo lacks consciousness, the\n capacity to feel pain, self-motivated\n activity, the capacity to community,\n and self-awareness.\n\n\n\nn5\n\nWarren's objection\n\n\n\nn3->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn4\n\nW2\nOnly beings with these capacities have\n a right to life\n\n\n\nn4->n5\n\n\n\n\n\nn5->n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[an objection targeting premise: a fetus does not yet have consciousness + only conscious beings have a right to life -> fetus does not have a right to life] [a reply is an objection to a previous objection: coma patients do not have consciousness but do have a right to life -> not-only conscious beings have a right to life]"
